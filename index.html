  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Effective date: April 2025</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to one of my apps — created by one person, powered by caffeine and chaotic energy. Here's the deal with your data (or lack thereof).</p>

  <h2>What Data I Collect</h2>
  <p>I don't want your personal info. Seriously. I’m too busy debugging to care about your dog’s birthday or browsing history. This app doesn’t collect personally identifiable information unless it needs to do something obvious — like saving settings or scores. If it does, I’ll tell you up front.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>If the app asks for permissions (like camera or location), it’s because it needs it to function, not because I’m secretly building a surveillance empire. Nothing leaves your device unless explicitly stated.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Stuff</h2>
  <p>I may use third-party services (like Google Play Services or analytics tools) which might collect basic usage data. I don’t control them. They're like the in-laws of app development — involved, but not living here. Check their privacy policies if you're curious.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>I try to keep things secure and not break the internet. But this isn’t Fort Knox — no system is 100% secure. Use common sense. Don't install sketchy apps. (This one isn’t sketchy. Hopefully.)</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>If I update this policy, I’ll change the date and maybe make it even more sarcastic. But the key info will still be here.</p>

  <h2>Questions?</h2>
  <p>Want to reach out? Whether it’s bugs, existential dread, or actual questions about privacy, hit me up: <a href="mailto:trevynmace@gmail.com">trevynmace@gmail.com</a></p>
